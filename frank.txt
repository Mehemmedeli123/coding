Today, I want to talk about Frank Morris, a man who is famous for escaping from Alcatraz Prison. Frank was born in 1926 and had a difficult childhood. He often got into trouble and spent a lot of time in jail.

In 1961, Frank was sent to Alcatraz, which was a very tough prison. It was known for being hard to escape from because it was on an island and surrounded by cold, strong water. Many people thought no one could ever get out.

While in Alcatraz, Frank started to think about how to escape. He was very clever and made a plan with two friends, the Anglin brothers, John and Clarence. They worked together to find things they could use for their escape. They collected materials like old tools and raincoats.

For months, they secretly dug holes in their cells and made dummy heads to put in their beds so the guards would think they were still there at night. On June 11, 1962, they put their plan into action. They climbed to the roof, made rafts from raincoats, and escaped into the cold water.

After they escaped, nobody knows for sure what happened to them. Some people believe they drowned, while others think they might have survived and made it to safety. This mystery has led to many stories and theories over the years.
